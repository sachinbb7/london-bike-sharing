# 🚴 London Bike Sharing Analysis

This repository contains an **end-to-end data analysis and prediction project** using the **London Bike Sharing dataset**. The goal is to analyze how weather, seasonality, and temporal features affect bike rental demand and build predictive models for demand forecasting.

---

## 📊 Project Objective
- Perform **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** on bike sharing usage.  
- Identify patterns across **season, weather, temperature, and holidays**.  
- Engineer features to better capture **time-series and cyclical patterns**.  
- Apply **machine learning models** to predict demand trends.  

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Python**  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  
- **Pandas, NumPy** – Data wrangling & preprocessing  
- **Matplotlib, Seaborn** – Visualization  
- **Scikit-learn** – Machine learning models  

---

## 📂 Project Workflow
1. **Data Loading & Cleaning** – Handle missing values, fix datatypes.  
2. **EDA & Visualization** – Explore demand trends by weather, month, weekday, hour.  
3. **Feature Engineering** – Create lag features, cyclical encoding for time.  
4. **Modeling** – Train/test split with regression models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting).  
5. **Evaluation** – RMSE, R² score, error analysis.  
6. **Insights** – Interpret the effect of weather and seasonality on demand.

## 🚀 Key Insights
- Demand is **highest in summer and spring** and lowest in winter.  
- **Temperature and clear weather** strongly correlate with higher rentals.  
- Peak demand occurs during **commuting hours (8 AM, 6 PM)**.  
- Models can capture seasonality and weather effects to forecast rentals.

## 📈 Why This Project Matters
Bike sharing services are an integral part of urban mobility. Understanding demand drivers helps operators:  
- Optimize **bike availability**.  
- Improve **customer experience**.  
- Reduce **shortages or excess supply**.  
- Enable **data-driven urban transport planning**.
